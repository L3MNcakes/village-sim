# Village-Sim

Village-Sim is an experiment in emergent story-telling. It is a
javascript application that runs in a browser powered by ReactJS/Flux.
Watch as a collection of independent agents attempt to build out a
simulated village, establish a local economy, and form relationships
with one another.

**NOTE:** This project is still early in development.
Many features have not yet been implemented.

The easiest way to run this app is through a Docker container.

```
git clone https://github.com/L3MNcakes/village-sim.git
cd village-sim
npm install
make start
```

The app should then be accessible at http://localhost:1234/
